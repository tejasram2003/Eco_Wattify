<h1>EcoWattify</h1>

<h2>About EcoWattify</h2>
<p>EcoWattify is a project aimed at helping users make energy-efficient choices for their homes. It uses a decision tree model to estimate electricity usage and provide insights into energy consumption.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<h3>Decision Trees</h3>
<p>The decision tree is a machine learning model used in EcoWattify to predict electricity usage based on various input parameters, such as house size and appliance wattages.</p>

<h2>How to Use EcoWattify</h2>
<p>To use EcoWattify, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter your house size in square feet.</li>
<li>Select appliances from the dropdown menu and provide their respective wattages.</li>
<li>Click the "Submit" button to get estimates.</li>
</ul>
